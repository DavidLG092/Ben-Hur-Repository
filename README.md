# Ben-Hur-Repository
 Ben-Hur Game project

Hello! How are you doing?

I will assume that if you are reading this, you are interested in what this project is all about, so here it is: this is a college project, where I am supposed to apply what I've learned in some sort of application, and I chose a game.

For those who don't know what Ben-Hur is, it is a 1880 book. But, in 1959, it was turned into a movie, and I believe this is its most famoust version. I have never read the book, nor watched the 1959 movie, but I have watched the 2016 one, and let me tell you something: it is a pretty cool movie! It has some action, some drama, some romance, and the best part of it: Jesus Christ! Yes, Jesus Christ, The Savior of the World!

Ben-Hur (originally called "Ben-Hur: A Tale of Christ") is the story of a jewish man, Judah Ben-Hur, who lived in the times of Christ. And throughout the story, Judah has some interactions with Jesus. In fact, the author uses Judah's story to share the Good News! And, with God's help, I hope to do the same with this game!

The project was develop in Godot, using GDScript. The sprites were developed with Pixelorama.

I hope you fun with it!
